# Home-Library-DB
This project idea results from my real life need for a catalogue of my books.
I have a growing collection of 700+ books at the moment, and feel it is time to introduce a digital system to keep record of the owned books and that will allow quick lookup of required titles. Another reason is to be able to quickly lookup a title to avoid duplicate book items purchase.
